# Triggers

Triggers are the starting point of every workflow. Published workflows will execute when the criteria on a trigger is met. 

Triggers can initiate one or more workflow executions from a single run. Wripple provides 2 different types of triggers to use in workflows.

- [Polling Triggers](polling-triggers)
- [Webhook Triggers](webhook-triggers)
