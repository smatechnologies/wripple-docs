# JSON Schema

JSON Schemas are an integral part of the Wripple apps. Wripple generates input forms, by using [Json Schema](https://json-schema.org/) standards and [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) library. 

JSON Schemas are used in [Configs](/developers/implementation/configs), [Actions](/developers/implementation/actions) and [Triggers](/developers/implementation/triggers).
