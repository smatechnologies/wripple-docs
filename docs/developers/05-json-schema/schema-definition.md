# Schema Definition

Schema files are required to build interactive apps. When creating [Configs](/developers/implementation/configs), [Actions](/developers/implementation/actions), or [Triggers](/developers/implementation/triggers) with user input, you must create a `[Name].Schema.json` file along with it.


> [Name] refers to the name of the config, action, trigger or lookup. 
> For example if your action name is `CreateUser` you must create a file `CreateUser.Schema.json` next to your `CreateUser.cs` file.
