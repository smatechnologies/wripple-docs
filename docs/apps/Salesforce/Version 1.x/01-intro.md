The basic requirement to use Salesforce Wripple App to access Salesforce data is to have a Salesforce org with API access. And you will also require an API Enabled user permission within that org. Salesforce provides API access with the following editions: 

- Professional Edition
- Performance Edition
- Enterprise Edition
- Unlimited Edition
- Developer Edition

See [App Configuration](02-application-config.md) for more details.
