# App Configuration

To be able to use Symitar with Wripple you will need the following:

1. **SymXchange Endpoint Directory** *(e.g. `http://hostname:port/SymXchange`)*
2. **User Number**
3. **Password**
4. **Device Number**
5. **Device Type**

You must also do the following in SymXchange for our integration to connect properly:

 - Whitelist our integrations IP address: `172.206.186.24`
 - set the `Allow User Authentication?` prompt to `Yes`

For more information on how to configure SymXchange, follow [this documentation](https://jackhenry.dev/symxchange-api-docs/installation-and-configuration/) from Symitar.
